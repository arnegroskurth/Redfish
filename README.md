# Redfish #

Redfish (with reference to the popular stockfish project) is an open-source chess engine that I created out of interest for game theory and to strengthen my C++ programming capabilities.

## Building & Running ##

There is a makefile in the project root to enable an easy building process.

```
cd {PROJECT_DIR}
make
./build/redfish
```

Apart from gcc and libc there are no external dependencies.
